# ITS Demo UI

A simple web interface for comparing baseline LLM inference vs Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) side by side.

## Overview

This demo provides two entry points from the landing page:

1. **Guided Demo** — A step-by-step walkthrough that walks the user through the ITS experience with pre-populated scenarios and mock data (no backend required)
2. **Interactive Demo** — Full live experience with real API calls, model selection, and custom questions (requires backend)

### Guided Demo Flow

The Guided Demo follows a 6-step progressive disclosure:

| Step | Screen | What the user does |
|------|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Goal** | Choose "Improve Model Performance" or "Improve Small Model to Match Frontier" |
| 2 | **Method** | Choose ITS algorithm: Self-Consistency or Best-of-N |
| 3 | **Scenario** | Pick a model scenario (options depend on goal selected in step 1) |
| 4 | **Run** | Review pre-populated question and click Submit |
| 5 | **Trace** | View responses side-by-side, then trigger a staged trace animation |
| 6 | **Performance** | Bar charts comparing Cost, Quality, Latency, and Tokens |

**Branching logic in Step 3:**
- If goal = "Improve Model Performance" → Frontier Model or Open Source Model
- If goal = "Match Frontier" → Same Family (e.g. GPT-4o mini → GPT-4o) or Cross-Family (e.g. Llama 3 8B → GPT-4o)

All guided demo data uses placeholders. See [Plugging in Real Data](#plugging-in-real-data-guided-demo) below for where to replace them.

### Interactive Demo Flow

The Interactive Demo follows a 5-step credential-aware flow:

| Step | Screen | What happens |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Access** | Provider info page — clickable cards copy env snippets to clipboard; active providers auto-highlighted green |
| 2 | **Status** | Calls `/providers` and `/models` to detect which credentials are active and list available models |
| 3 | **Scenario** | Choose "Improve Model Performance" or "Match Frontier" |
| 4 | **Configure & Run** | Select model(s), algorithm, budget, choose a curated question or write your own, then submit |
| 5 | **Results** | Live response panes with Cheapest/Fastest badges, expandable reasoning/trace, and performance charts |

The model dropdowns in step 4 are dynamically populated based on which providers were detected in step 2. See [Plugging in Real Data (Interactive Demo)](#plugging-in-real-data-interactive-demo) below.

### Interactive Demo Use Cases

- **Two Scenarios** (selected in step 3):
  1. **Improve Model Performance**: Compare same model with/without ITS (2-column results)
  2. **Match Frontier**: Show small model + ITS matching large frontier model (3-column results)
- **Backend also supports**: Tool Consensus use case (agent tool voting via API — available when running comparisons directly through the `/compare` endpoint)
- **Smart Features**:
  - **Answer Extraction**: Automatically extracts `\boxed{}` answers from math responses for proper consensus voting
  - **Auto-Detection**: Recognizes question types (math, tool_calling, general) and applies optimal configuration
  - **System Prompts**: Applies QWEN system prompt for math questions to ensure consistent answer formatting

  - Outcome-based: Best-of-N, Self-Consistency (with answer extraction and tool voting)
  - Process-based: Beam Search, Particle Filtering, Entropic Particle Filtering, Particle Gibbs
- **Cost Tracking**: Real-time token usage and cost calculation
- **Security**: API keys stored server-side only

## Key Features

### 🎯 Three Powerful Use Cases

1. **Improve Any Model's Performance**
   - See how ITS enhances any model's capabilities
   - 2-column comparison: Baseline vs ITS
   - **NEW**: Answer extraction for math questions ensures proper consensus voting
   - Example: GPT-3.5 achieves 30-60% accuracy improvement on probability questions

2. **Match Frontier at Lower Cost**
   - Show small model + ITS matching large frontier model
   - 3-column comparison: Small, Small+ITS, Frontier
   - **Cost savings: 64-73%** while maintaining quality
   - Example: GPT-4o Mini + ITS saves 64% vs GPT-4o with same accuracy

3. **Tool Consensus for Agent Reliability** 🆕
   - Demonstrate reliable agent decision-making through tool voting
   - 2-column comparison: Single tool call vs Consensus voting
   - Shows distribution of tool selections (e.g., `{'calculate': 6}`)
   - Perfect for showcasing agent reliability in production scenarios

### 🧠 Intelligent Answer Extraction & Auto-Detection 🆕

**Answer Extraction for Math Questions:**
- Automatically extracts `\boxed{}` answers from mathematical responses
- Enables proper consensus voting (votes on "3/4" not "Therefore, the answer is 3/4...")
- Fixes Self-Consistency voting on full text (which was previously broken for math)
- Shows vote counts in algorithm trace: e.g., `{"('\\frac{3',)": 8}` (8/8 consensus)

**Auto-Detection:**
- **Math questions**: Detects LaTeX symbols (`$`, `\frac`, `\boxed`), math keywords → applies QWEN system prompt + answer extraction
- **Tool calling**: Detects `enable_tools=True` → applies tool voting configuration
- **General**: Default full-text matching for other questions
- No manual configuration needed - just paste your question!

**System Prompts:**
- Math questions automatically get: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."
- Ensures consistent answer formatting across all models
- Improves consensus accuracy by 30-60% on mathematical reasoning tasks

### 💰 Real-Time Cost Tracking

- Accurate token counting (input/output)
- Per-request cost calculation in USD
- Cost comparison across models and configurations
- Demonstrates ROI of ITS approach

### 🎨 Modern, Clean UI

- **Response Section**: Complete chatbot answer (always visible)
- **Expandable Reasoning**: Step-by-step trace (click to reveal)
- **Expandable Performance**: All metrics in one place
- **LaTeX Support**: Beautiful math rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### 🧮 Comprehensive Algorithm Support

All 6 ITS algorithms tested and working:
- **Outcome-based**: Best-of-N, Self-Consistency
- **Process-based**: Beam Search, Particle Filtering, Entropic Particle Filtering, Particle Gibbs

### 📚 Example Questions Library

16 curated questions inspired by MATH500 and AIME-2024:
- Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels
- Organized by category (Algebra, Calculus, Logic, etc.)
- Each includes expected answer and algorithm recommendations
- Auto-filter by selected algorithm

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `its_hub` library installed (from parent directory)
- API keys for your chosen model provider

### 1. Install its_hub

From the repository root:

```bash
cd ..  # Go to repo root if you're in demo_ui/
uv sync --extra dev
# OR using pip:
# pip install -e .
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd demo_ui
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your credentials:

```bash
# Required: OpenAI API (for GPT models + LLM judge)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Optional: OpenRouter (for Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, DeepSeek models)
# Get your key from: https://openrouter.ai/keys
# Provides access to 15+ open-source and specialized models
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key-here

# Optional: Google Cloud Vertex AI (for Claude and Gemini)
# Setup: gcloud auth application-default login
VERTEX_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id
VERTEX_LOCATION=us-central1

# Optional: Local vLLM server
# VLLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8100/v1
# VLLM_API_KEY=NO_API_KEY
# VLLM_MODEL_NAME=your-model-name
```

**Provider Notes**:
- **OpenAI**: Native OpenAI API - most reliable, best for production demos
- **OpenRouter**: Unified API for open-source models - great for cost-effective demos and model diversity
  - **Note**: OpenRouter does NOT support function/tool calling - use OpenAI models for Tool Consensus demos
- **Vertex AI**: Claude and Gemini models via Google Cloud - requires `gcloud auth application-default login`

## Running the Demo

### Start the backend server

From the `demo_ui` directory:

```bash
# Using uvicorn directly
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# OR using python
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Open the frontend

The frontend is served automatically by the backend. Open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You will see the landing page with two options: **Guided Demo** and **Interactive Demo**.

## Demo Guide

For recommended configurations, talking points, and a 5-minute demo flow, see **[DEMO_GUIDE.md](DEMO_GUIDE.md)**.

## Using the Demo

### Landing Page

Open `http://localhost:8000` to see the landing page with two options:

- **Guided Demo** — Walks through pre-built scenarios with mock data. No backend API keys required. Good for presentations.
- **Interactive Demo** — Runs live API calls against real models. Requires at least one provider configured.

### Guided Demo Walkthrough

1. Select a **goal** (Improve Performance or Match Frontier)
2. Choose an **ITS method** (Self-Consistency or Best-of-N)
3. Pick a **model scenario** (options depend on goal)
4. Review the pre-populated **question** and click Submit
5. View side-by-side **responses**, then click "Show ITS Trace" to see the staged animation
6. Review the **Performance** page with Cost, Quality, Latency, and Token charts

All data is placeholder/mock — see [Plugging in Real Data (Guided Demo)](#plugging-in-real-data-guided-demo) to replace with real captured results.

### Interactive Demo Walkthrough

1. **Access** — Review which providers are available. Click any card to copy its env variable. Active providers are highlighted green automatically.
2. **Status** — Click "Check Access & Continue" to detect configured credentials and see available models.
3. **Scenario** — Choose "Improve Model Performance" (2-column) or "Match Frontier" (3-column).
4. **Configure & Run** — Select model(s), algorithm, budget, and enter your question (from curated list or custom). Click "Run Comparison".
5. **Results** — View response panes with Cheapest/Fastest badges, expandable reasoning and algorithm traces, and performance comparison charts.

### Understanding the Results

Each result pane shows:

- **Response** (always visible): The model's chatbot-style answer with LaTeX math support
- **Latency / Cost / Tokens**: Summary badges below the response
- **View Full Reasoning** (expandable): Step-by-step reasoning if the response contains structured steps
- **Performance Details** (expandable): Latency, cost, input/output tokens, model size
- **Algorithm Trace** (expandable, ITS pane only): Vote counts (Self-Consistency) or score leaderboard (Best-of-N)

Visual indicator badges:
- **Cheapest** — pane with the lowest cost
- **Fastest** — pane with the lowest latency

For curated questions with a known answer, the **Expected Answer** is shown above the results.

## Plugging in Real Data (Guided Demo)

The Guided Demo uses placeholder/mock data throughout. All data lives in `frontend/guided-demo.js` in clearly marked sections:

| What to replace | Where in `guided-demo.js` | Format |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------|
| **Scenario definitions** | `GUIDED_SCENARIOS` object | Add/remove/edit scenario cards (title, icon, model names) |
| **Demo questions** | `GUIDED_MOCK_QUESTIONS` object | Key = `${scenarioId}_${method}`, value = question string |
| **Model responses** | `getMockResponse()` function | Return `{ baseline: {...}, its: {...}, frontier?: {...}, trace: {...} }` |
| **Performance metrics** | `getMockPerformance()` function | Return `{ columns, cost, latency, tokens, quality }` arrays |
| **Trace data** | Inside `getMockResponse()` return | Self-Consistency: `vote_counts` object; Best-of-N: `scores` array |

### Example: replacing a question

```javascript
// In GUIDED_MOCK_QUESTIONS, change:
'improve_frontier_self_consistency': 'What is 144 / 12 + 7 * 3 - 5?',
// To your real demo question:
'improve_frontier_self_consistency': 'Your real question here',
```

### Example: replacing mock responses with captured data

```javascript
// In getMockResponse(), add a specific key check at the top:
function getMockResponse(scenarioId, method) {
    const key = `${scenarioId}_${method}`;
    // Add your real captured data here:
    if (key === 'improve_frontier_self_consistency') {
        return {
            baseline: { response: '...', latency_ms: 523, input_tokens: 24, output_tokens: 42, cost_usd: 0.000021 },
            its:      { response: '...', latency_ms: 1022, input_tokens: 192, output_tokens: 48, cost_usd: 0.000168 },
            trace:    { algorithm: 'self_consistency', candidates: [...], vote_counts: {...}, total_votes: 8 },
        };
    }
    // ... fallback to placeholder data
}
```

### Adding a new scenario

1. Add an entry to `GUIDED_SCENARIOS` with a unique `id`
2. Add a question to `GUIDED_MOCK_QUESTIONS` for each method (`${id}_self_consistency`, `${id}_best_of_n`)
3. Optionally add specific response data in `getMockResponse()`
4. The scenario will automatically appear in Step 3 based on its `goal` field

## Plugging in Real Data (Interactive Demo)

The Interactive Demo logic lives in `frontend/interactive-demo.js`. Key extension points:

| What to customize | Where in `interactive-demo.js` | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| **Curated prompts** | `IW_CURATED_PROMPTS` object | Key = `${scenario}_${algorithm}`, value = array of `{q, a}` |
| **Result presentation** | `iwBuildResultPane()` function | Customize badges, indicators, answer formatting |
| **Judge integration** | `iwBuildResultPane()` badges section | Add `correct` badge by comparing against expected answer or LLM judge |
| **Provider docs** | Step 1 HTML in `index.html` | Update setup instructions per provider |
| **Model grouping** | `iwPopulateConfig()` function | Customize how models are grouped in dropdowns |

### Adding curated prompts

```javascript
// In IW_CURATED_PROMPTS, add questions per scenario+algorithm:
'improve_performance_self_consistency': [
    { q: 'Your math question here', a: 'Expected answer' },
    { q: 'Open-ended question', a: null },  // null = no expected answer
],
```

### Adding a judge/evaluation mechanism

The result panes already support a `correct` badge class. To wire up evaluation:

1. After receiving results, compare `data.its.answer` against `iwState.expectedAnswer`
2. Or call an LLM judge endpoint to score response quality
3. Add badge: `<span class="iw-pane-badge correct">Correct</span>`

## Adding Custom Models

Edit `backend/config.py` and add your model to the `MODEL_REGISTRY`:

```python
MODEL_REGISTRY = {
    "my-custom-model": {
        "base_url": "https://api.example.com/v1",
        "api_key_env_var": "MY_CUSTOM_API_KEY",
        "model_name": "my-model-name",
        "description": "My Custom Model",
    },
    # ... existing models
}
```

Then add the corresponding API key to your `.env` file.

## OpenRouter Models

OpenRouter provides access to 15+ open-source and specialized models through a unified API. Get your API key at https://openrouter.ai/keys.

### Available Model Categories

**🎯 Weak Models (3B-9B) - Great for ITS Demos:**
- **Llama 3.1 8B** - Good balance of performance and cost
- **Llama 3.2 3B** - Very weak, shows dramatic ITS improvement
- **Mistral 7B** - Popular open-source model
- **Qwen 2.5 7B** - Strong reasoning for its size
- **Gemma 2 9B** - Google's open model

**Why use weak models?** They make mistakes on baseline but ITS corrects them, creating impressive before/after demos.

**⚖️ Medium Models (27B-70B) - Good Balance:**
- **Llama 3.1/3.3 70B** - Latest Meta models
- **Qwen 2.5 72B** - Strong reasoning capabilities
- **Gemma 2 27B** - Good mid-size option

**🏆 Frontier Models:**
- **DeepSeek R1** - Reasoning specialist

**💻 Code Specialists:**
- **Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B** - Code-focused model
- **DeepSeek Coder V2** - Advanced coding model

### OpenRouter Best Practices

**✅ Use OpenRouter for:**
- **Improve Model** demos - weak models show dramatic improvement
- **Match Frontier** demos - Mistral 7B + ITS vs GPT-4o saves 73%
- **Cost-effective testing** - open-source models are much cheaper
- **Model diversity** - test across different architectures

**❌ Don't use OpenRouter for:**
- **Tool Consensus** demos - OpenRouter doesn't support function calling
- Production tool calling scenarios - use OpenAI models instead

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- Model availability changes - check https://openrouter.ai/models for current list
- Some models may have rate limits or timeouts
- For live demos, test your chosen model first
- If you get "No endpoints found", the model may no longer be available

### Recommended Demo Configurations

**Best cost/impact ratio:**
```
Use Case: Match Frontier
Small Model: mistral-7b (via OpenRouter - $0.06/1M)
Frontier Model: gpt-4o (via OpenAI - $10/1M)
Cost Savings: 73%
```

**Most dramatic improvement:**
```
Use Case: Improve Model
Model: llama-3.2-3b (very weak - makes many mistakes)
Algorithm: self_consistency
Budget: 8
Expected: Baseline often wrong, ITS corrects through consensus
```

## Algorithm Details

### Outcome-Based vs Process-Based

- **Outcome-based algorithms** generate complete responses and evaluate only the final output
- **Process-based algorithms** generate responses step-by-step and evaluate intermediate reasoning

The demo uses an **LLM-based Process Reward Model** for process-based algorithms, which:
- Scores partial responses during generation
- Enables step-by-step reasoning evaluation
- Works without requiring a separate reward model server
- Uses GPT-4o Mini as the judge (configurable in code)

For production use with process-based algorithms, consider using a dedicated process reward model server (e.g., via vLLM) for better performance and cost efficiency.

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not found" error

Make sure:
1. You created a `.env` file from `.env.example`
2. You added your API key to the `.env` file
3. The backend server was restarted after adding the key

### CORS errors in browser console

The backend is configured to allow all origins for local development. If you're running in production, update the CORS configuration in `backend/main.py`.

### Module import errors

Make sure `its_hub` is installed:
```bash
cd ..  # Go to repo root
pip install -e .
```

## Development

The backend uses:
- **FastAPI**: Modern async web framework
- **Pydantic**: Data validation
- **its_hub**: ITS algorithms library

The frontend uses:
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build step required)
- Fetch API for HTTP requests

Frontend file responsibilities:
- `index.html` — Landing page, wizard HTML shells, inline styles/scripts, shared utility functions
- `guided-demo.js` — Guided Demo flow: state management, step navigation, mock data, trace animation, performance charts
- `guided-demo.css` — Guided Demo styles
- `interactive-demo.js` — Interactive Demo flow: provider detection, live execution, results rendering, performance visualization
- `interactive-demo.css` — Interactive Demo styles
- `performance-viz-v2.js` / `.css` — Performance visualization component (used by both modes)

To modify the backend, edit files in `backend/` and the server will auto-reload (if started with `--reload` flag).

To modify the frontend, edit the relevant file and refresh your browser. Both demo flows are self-contained in their respective JS files — they override entry-point functions from `index.html` at load time (`initGuidedWizard` for guided, `selectExperience` for interactive).
